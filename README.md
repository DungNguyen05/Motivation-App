## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Permissions

The app needs notification permissions to work properly:

- **First Launch**: The app will ask for permission to send notifications
- **If Denied**: You'll see a warning message in the app
- **To Fix**: Go to your phone's Settings > Apps > Reminder App > Permissions > Allow Notifications

### Limitations

- **Background Limits**: Notifications may not work if the phone's battery optimization is too aggressive
- **iOS Testing**: Notifications work differently on iOS simulator vs real device
- **Time Zones**: Reminders are set in your device's local time zone

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**
- Make sure you ran `npm install`
- Check that Node.js is installed correctly
- Try deleting `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again

**QR code won't scan:**
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Try the `expo start --tunnel` command instead

**Notifications not working:**
- Check that notifications are enabled in your phone settings
- Make sure the reminder time is in the future
- Test on a real device (notifications may not work on simulators)

**App crashes:**
- Check the terminal for error messages
- Try restarting the development server with `npm start`

### Getting Help
